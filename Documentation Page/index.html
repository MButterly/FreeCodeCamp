                        Having a dog is a rewarding but challenging experience! Sometimes you will have to walk the pooch in the rain but in return you will receive undying loyalty and lower blood pressure!

                        Not only are dogs good for your health, they will also help you score babes. Girls are hard-wired to think that guys that dogs trust will make good boyfriends. This is only sometimes true.

                        Dogs should be fed several times per day. If you aren't ready for this kind of commitment, just buy a cactus.

                    <code>
                        Don't be cheap and buy that $20/bag crap. Your dog will quickly realize that you're a cheapskate and learn to hate you - and you will deserve it. Pony up the extra cash and buy decent food.

                        Dogs need to be walked. People need to be walked. It's a match made in heaven.

                        The farther you walk your dog, the more he will like you. The curve is linear through the first three walks then quickly plateaus afterwards. You may have to buy new shoes.

                        Sadly, you will have to have your dog probed several times per year by a vet. This is similar to people. Old dogs and old men alike have to have their prostates periodically tickled by professionals. You can bond afterwards with treats/beer and lament your lots in life.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        You will have to subject your dog to long waits, jabs, and scary vet techs. The fact that we have to do this at all demonstrates our failure as a species to dedicate the necessary resources to eliminate ticks, fleas, dirty people, and other parasites.

                        This is easily the best part of having a pet. They will help you sleep in on rainy days when no one should be at work.

                    <code>
                        Care should be taken when deciding the end-point of the snuggle. When it is over, the dog will let you knkow - not the other way around.

                        Treats should be given at least once per day and when good behavior warrants it. This applies to people and to dogs.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        Sometimes treats can be placed inside toys - a double delight! Consult with your physician about the use of a Kong in the play area.

                        Dogs strongly feel that the pack should sleep together. They aren't wrong.

                        You will sometimes be asked to give your spot in the bed to the dog. This is expected and you should comply without delay.
