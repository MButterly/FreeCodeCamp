                        Having a dog is a rewarding but challenging experience! Sometimes you will have to walk the pooch in the rain but in return you will receive undying loyalty and lower blood pressure!

                        Dogs should be fed several times per day. If you aren't ready for this, just buy a cactus.

                        Dogs need to be walked. People need to be walked. It's a match made in heaven.

                        Sadly, you will have to have your dog probed several times per year by a vet. This is similar to people. Old dogs and old men alike have to have their prostates periodically tickled by professionals. You can bond afterwards with treats/beer and lament your lots in life.

                        This is easily the best part of having a pet. They will help you sleep in on rainy days when no one should be at work.

                        Treats should be given at least once per day when good behavior warrants it. This applies to people and to dogs.

                        Dogs strongly feel that the pack should sleep together. They aren't wrong.
